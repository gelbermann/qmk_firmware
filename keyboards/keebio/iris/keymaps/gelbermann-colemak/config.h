// ==== Mouse keys configuration taken from: keyboards/40percentclub/gherkin/keymaps/pierrec83/config.h ====
// Set the mouse settings to a comfortable speed/accuracy trade-off
// Assume the screen refresh rate is 60 Htz or higher
// The default is 50. This makes the mouse ~3 times faster and more accurate
#define MOUSEKEY_INTERVAL 16
// The default is 20. Since we made the mouse about 3 times faster with the previous setting,
// give it more time to accelerate to max speed to retain precise control over short distances.
#define MOUSEKEY_TIME_TO_MAX 40
// The default is 300. Let's try and make this as low as possible while keeping the cursor responsive
#define MOUSEKEY_DELAY 100
// It makes sense to use the same delay for the mouseweel
#define MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_DELAY 100
// The default is 100
#define MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_INTERVAL 50
// The default is 40
#define MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_TIME_TO_MAX 100
